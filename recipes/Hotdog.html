          <p class="image-text one"><h3>The thick ground beef sauce that completes these classic dogs is slightly sweet, slightly spicy, and slightly salty. "The story of how the Coney Island hog dog got to the Midwest is pretty straightforward, but no one really knows exactly how the wiener first came to be topped with what is basically a hot meat relish," says Chef John. Top the meat sauce with plenty of chopped onions and mustard.</h3></p>

      <ul>  
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 extra-long hot dog buns</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <ul><li><strong>STEP 1</strong></li></ul>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove the burger dogs from the plastic wrap and place on the grill, perpendicular to the grates. Cook until burgers are browned but still pink inside, 4 to 5 minutes, flip, and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Place a slice of cheese on each burger dog and grill to medium doneness (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F/60 degrees C). Remove and rest 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <ul><li><strong>STEP 2</strong></li></ul>
        <li>Toast hot dog buns on the grill and spread each with 2 teaspoons mayonnaise. Place burger dog on each bun and squirt 1 tablespoon of ketchup on top.</li>
